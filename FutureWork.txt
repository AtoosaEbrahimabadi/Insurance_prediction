
## Future Improvements
*   **Experiment with other regression models:** Try Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, or Support Vector Regression.
*   **More extensive hyperparameter tuning:** Use a larger search space or different tuning techniques like RandomizedSearchCV or Bayesian Optimization.
*   **Feature engineering:** Create new features from existing ones (e.g., BMI categories, age groups).
*   **Cross-validation strategy:** Explore different `cv` values or strategies in `GridSearchCV`.
*   **Error analysis:** Investigate cases where the model performs poorly to understand its limitations.
*   **Deployment:** Package the model into an API (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) for real-world use.
